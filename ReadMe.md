# A simple P2P class written in Java

This is a simple P2P class written in java, as of now it's nothing special and I will expand upon the idea with some encryption algorithms and a SimpleTerminal class to create a CLI application for P2P communication.

## ToDo

1) Add some simple encryption algorithms, like ROT and RSA
2) Test the P2P class on other computers except my own for obvious reasons
3) Create the SimpleTerminal class

## Notes

This is a project I have created with a single day of learning Java after now using Java for a few months, because of that there might be some bad practices.
