# A simple P2P class written in Java

This is a simple P2P class written in java, as of now it's nothing special and it won't be anything special because it's.... simple.... but I still enjoyed making it !

<br>

## ToDo

- Test the P2P class on other computers except my own for obvious reasons
- **MAYBE** I will add a transferFile() function, no promises tho

<br>

## Notes

This is just a fun side project, nothing special !!!!
